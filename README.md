# Image Classifier Udacity

This repository contains an image classification project that was completed as part of the Udacity Nano Degree program.

## Project Overview

The Image Classifier Udacity project focuses on developing an image classification model using deep learning techniques. The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify images into predefined categories or labels.

The project utilizes a pre-existing deep learning architecture, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and fine-tunes it on a custom dataset. Transfer learning is employed, where the model is initially trained on a large dataset (such as ImageNet) and then adapted to a specific image classification task.

The key steps involved in the project are:

1. Dataset Preparation: The project requires a dataset of labeled images for training, validation, and testing. The dataset is organized into appropriate directories with each category having its own subdirectory.

2. Model Training: The pre-trained model is loaded, and the fully connected layers are replaced with custom layers specific to the classification task. The model is then trained on the dataset using techniques like stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation.

3. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using a separate test dataset to measure its accuracy and performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated.

4. Model Inference: The trained model can be used to classify new images. Given an input image, the model predicts its category or label with a probability score.
